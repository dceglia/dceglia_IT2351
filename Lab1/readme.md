<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<h3>Creating a Database from a Script</h3>

(Using the Northwind Database for IT2351 SQL course)

Northwind Database was previously uploaded to the Workbench during classroom examples.

Created new script by going to file --> open SQL script --> and selecting daveceglianorthwind.sql. I then added notation saying that it was edited by me with the date.

<h3>Retrieving Data From Two or More Tables</h3>

According to Murach's "MySQL", "a join combines columns from two or more tables into a result set based on the join conditions you specify. For an inner join, only those rows that satisfy the join condition are included in the result set... an outer join returns all of the rows from one of the tables involved in the join, regardless of whether the join condition is true."
